## About Us

We are a friendly and enthusiastic group of Central Ohio Pythonistas. We meet
most Thursday evenings for informal dojos, occasionally for lunch on various
days of the week, and have a monthly meeting usually on the last Monday of the
month. To have lunch at your favorite place, announce the time and place on the
[mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/centraloh).

After our monthly meetings we like to adjourn to some nearby eatery to enjoy
good food, good drinks, and good conversation.

We have code on our [github repository](https://github.com/cohpy), especially of
challenges where people solved problems using Python in very different ways.
